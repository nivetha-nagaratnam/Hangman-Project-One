# Gingy's Christmas Journey

## **Overview & Getting Started** 

Gingy's Christmas Journey is a hangaman game that can be played by kids. Gingy is a gingerbread man whose life is in danger and it's in your hands to save
him and reconnect him with Santa. The instructions are simple. Choose a fairytale theme and try to guess the word. If guessed correctly, Gingy survives. If not, 
sorry Gingy... You will be given one hint, so use it wisely. Good luck, click here to start the journey https://nivetha-nagaratnam.github.io/Hangman-Project-One/.

## **Technologies Used** 

Technologies used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## **Next Steps** 

Some next steps for this game would be adding animations and making a mobile version. I would add animations to show when a player wins or loses. I would also try to animate the process of 
losing lives in the game.
